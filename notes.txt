-how to generate B matrix, any tips? wtf going on
-do we need to generate position and velocity errors? 
-matrix A has to be L? or not?
-what is control law?

-try to implement theorem 3 control law into code before asking professor

solutions to try: 
-modify launch file with bearing positons, use double integrator with u=0 for leaders and
 papers u 
- better to use template formation control discrete
- A = double integrator [[0 0][0 1]] B = double integrator [[0 1]]
- start with leaders at zero velocity and gradually add difficulty



TASK 1
-show steps, ask where error is?
